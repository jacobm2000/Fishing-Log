# Fishing-Log
This Flask app includes a SQLite database, letting users easily make profiles to keep track of their catches. Users can edit catch details later to add more info. It also has a search function for checking out other profiles, following them, and liking posts. Plus, there's a Latest page to see the newest posts from other users on the platform.
